    "# Data Mining US National Park API\n",
    "The [US National Park Service has an API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm) that can be used to get a variety of information about campgrounds, parks, events, and much more. In order to access the API, [you must register](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm) with a name and e-mail and receive an API key. There is [a guide to using the API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/guides.htm), however I had some issues with the information provided and I suspect the API has been changed without the documentation not updated. Below I go over what worked for me."
